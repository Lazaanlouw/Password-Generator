## API Integration

This project demonstrates REST API integration. The "Generate Password with API" option fetches a password from the PasswordWolf API, allowing for customized options:

- Length of password
- Include numbers, symbols, uppercase, and lowercase letters
- Save and copy password after fetching

This shows ability to interact with external services and process JSON responses in Python.
